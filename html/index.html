Welcome to NatProDB, a digital database that contains chemical structures that have been extracted from plants of the Brazilian semiarid region. NatProDB allows to visualize the structures, their properties and perform searches in the database.

NatProDB contains 556 compounds in ready-to-dock, 2D formats. The motivation of constructing NatProDB emerged from the fact that the semiarid region of Brazil is a poorly studied region and lack of depository from natural products. NatProDB was conceived by the Laboratório de Modelagem Molceular and Laboratório de Computação de Alto Desempenho of the State University of Feira de Santana.
